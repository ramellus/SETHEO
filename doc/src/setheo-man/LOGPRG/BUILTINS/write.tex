{\bf Description.}
The printable representation of the given term is printed.
Logical variables are printed in the form {\tt X\_}{\em number}, where
{\em number\/} identifies the variable in a unique way.
Please note that these numbers may differ from run to run.

Quoted special characters (e.g., {\verb+ \n+}) in strings are expanded.

{\bf Example.}
\begin{verbatim}
p(X) :- $write("X="), $write(X), $write("\n\007").
\end{verbatim}

When called with {\tt <- p(f(a))} this clause will print
{\tt X=f(a)}, a new-line, and will ring the bell.
