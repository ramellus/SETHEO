terms to be checked for syntactical equality.

This built-in succeeds, if {\tt T1} is syntactical equal to
{\tt T2}.
\end{description}

\noindent
{\bf Description.}
This predicate checks two terms for syntactical equality.
Two terms are syntactical equal, if
\begin{itemize}
\item
both are the same symbolic constants (or strings)
\item
both are the {\em same\/} variable,
\item
the terms are of the form
$f^1(t_1^1,\ldots,t_n^1)$ and
$f^2(t_1^2,\ldots,t_n^2)$, and the function symbols $f^1,f^2$ and all
pairs of subterms $t^1_i,t^2_i$ are syntactical equal.
\end{itemize}

\vspace*{0.5cm}
\noindent
{\bf Example.}
\begin{verbatim}
p(X)<- $eq(f(a),X).
p(X)<- $eq(f(Y),X).
p(X)<- f(Y) == X.
\end{verbatim}
The first clause succeeds, if $X$ is instantiated to $f(a)$.
The second clause, however, does {\em never\/} succeed, since
$Y$ only occurs only once in the second clause.
The third clause is equivalent to the second one.
