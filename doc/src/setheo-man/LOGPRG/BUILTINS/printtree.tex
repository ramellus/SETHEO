This built-in always succeeds.

{\bf Description.}
When this built-in is encountered, it appends the current tableau
to the file {\em file}.tree.

\vspace*{0.5cm}
\noindent
{\bf Notes.}
(1) In the current version, {\bf xptree(1)} can only display one proof at a time.\\
(2) The entire tableau is printed, not just the part, starting with the
current clause.

\vspace*{0.5cm}
\noindent
{\bf Example.}
\begin{verbatim}
find_all_proofs :- q(X,Y),$ptree,$fail.
\end{verbatim}
When called, this clause tries to find all solutions for the subgoal
{\tt q(X,Y)}, and appends the proof for each solution to the tree-file.
