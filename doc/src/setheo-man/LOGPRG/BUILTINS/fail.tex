\begin{description}
\item[Synopsis:]
	{\tt \$fail}
\item[Low Level Name:]
	{\tt fail }
\item[Result:]\ \\
This built-in always fails.
\end{description}

\vspace*{0.5cm}
\noindent
{\bf Description.}
This built-in unconditionally fails and thus represents an
unsolvable subgoal.

\vspace*{0.5cm}
\noindent
{\bf Example.}
\begin{verbatim}
p(X) <- q(X,Y),$write(Y),$write("\n"),$fail.
\end{verbatim}

This clause tries to find all solutions for the subgoal {\tt q} and
prints the corresponding substitution of the variable {\tt Y}.
