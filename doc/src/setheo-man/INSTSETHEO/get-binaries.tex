\section{Getting the Binaries}\label{sec:get-bin}

The SETHEO system can be obtained via anonymous ftp. The ftp--server
provides a package containing the binaries of the basic SETHEO
programs for specific platforms (see Figure~\ref{fig:platforms}), the
manpages, example problems and a file with installation
hints. Binaries for other platforms will be available in the future. 

\input{INSTSETHEO/platforms}

To get this package you have to connect the ftp--server either by
\begin{verbatim}
        ftp ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de
\end{verbatim}
or by
\begin{verbatim} 
        ftp 131.159.0.198
\end{verbatim}
If the connection is established, the ftp--server will ask for your
name and your e--mail address:
\begin{verbatim}
        Name: anonymous
        Password: <your-e-mail-address>
\end{verbatim}
The next thing you have to do is change to the right directory, set
the transfer mode to {\tt binary} and get the {\tt
setheo.solaris.tar.gz} file (respectively {\tt setheo.hp.tar.gz} or
{\tt setheo.sunos.tar.gz}, or {\tt setheo.linux.tar.gz}): 
\begin{verbatim}
        ftp> cd /local/lehrstuhl/jessen/Automated_Reasoning/SETHEO
        ftp> binary
        ftp> get setheo.solaris.tar.gz
\end{verbatim}
You can get a short version of this description as well. After this
leave the ftp--server: 
\begin{verbatim}
        ftp> get README
        ftp> bye
\end{verbatim}
