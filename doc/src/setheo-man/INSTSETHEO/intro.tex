\section{Introduction}

This section is about how to install the SETHEO system binaries at
your own  computer. For sevaral platforms (including Sun Os, Sun
Solaris, HPUX, Linux) binaries of the SETHEO code are available via
ftp. In addition to the programs examples and manpages are provided. 

If you run another operation system or if you want to look at the
source code, too, you can also get the sources. Read
Chapter~\ref{chap:9}, how to obtain the sources.
