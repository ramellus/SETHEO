\section{SETHEO System Overview}

The SETHEO system consists of a set of (individual) programs,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig.1}. Data are exchanged between the
modules using files. Parameters for each program are given in the
command line.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\caption{Parts of the SETHEO system}
\label{fig.1}
\end{figure}

The indivual programs will be described in detail below. They are:

\begin{description}
\item[plop]
This program\footnote{This program is distributed as an ``as is'' version
without support. For details see Section~\ref{sec:plop}.} converts
formulae in first order notation (with quantifiers and standard
(infix-) operators (e.g., $\wedge, \vee$) into a set of clauses.
\item[inwasm]
This program is the {\em compiler\/} for SETHEO. It takes a formula
(as a set of clauses) or a logic program as its input. Details of the
input language (LOP) and its syntax are described in detail in
Section~\ref{sec:lop}.
{\bf Inwasm} performs several preprocessing steps which try
to reduce the search space spanned by the formula. Typical preprocessing
steps are the generation of syntactical constraints or the elimination
of pure literals.
Then, assembler instructions for the SETHEO Abstract Machine \SAM\ 
are generated. Optionally, {\bf inwasm} can output 
the preprocessed formula in LOP-syntax.
This option is helpful, if the preprocessed formula is to be
modified by hand (or some other filter), before it should be compiled
for the \SAM.
Details are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:inwasm}.
\item[wasm]
The assembler {\bf wasm} converts assembler instructions (as normally
produced by {\bf inwasm} and converts them into a binary
(currently actually hexadecimal) representation which can be directly
read into the SETHEO Abstract Machine.
Symbolic labels and constants are resolved. Furthermore, the
code is somewhat optimized to reduce the size of the produced code file.

\item[sam]
This program is the interpreter of the SETHEO Abstract Machine
\SAM. After loading the code-file as prepared by {\bf wasm}, the
abstract machine is started with given parameters.
If a proof could be found, the given time-limit has been exceeded,
or upon request, statistical information is printed on the screen
and into a log-file. In case, a proof could be found, the tableau
with instantiated literals is generated and written into a file.

\item[xptree]
This program is X-based graphical viewer for tableaux, generated
by {\bf sam}. The tableau is displayed as a tree with literals
(and additional information) as its nodes. Scrolling, selection and
hinding of subtableaux can be accomplished using the mouse.
\end{description}

Around these basic programs, additional modules are located which
use the basic programs. They increase the functionality of the
SETHEO system and facilitates its usage.

New modules are likely to be added in further distribution versions
of SETHEO. Therefore, modules which are new for the current version of
SETHEO are marked clearly.
Where appropriate, these modules are described in detail in separate
subsections.
The modules are listed in alphabetical order.

\begin{description}
\item[clop]
This script combines the compiler {\bf inwasm} and the assembler
{\bf wasm}. All command-line parameters are passed to the compiler
{\bf inwasm}.
\item[delta]
is a preprocessor which takes a formula in LOP syntax, and produces
one in the same syntax. {\bf Delta} generates unit-lemmata in a bottom-up
way which are added to the original formula. In many cases, this combination
of bottom-up preprocessing (using {\bf Delta}) and subsequent top-down
processing by the \SAM\ results in a dramatic increase of efficiency.
{\bf Delta} uses {\bf inwasm, wasm,} and {\bf sam}.
\item[rctheo]
\item[idtheo]
\item[setheo]
This script represents the top-level script of the SETHEO system.
Given a formula in LOP-notation, the compiler, assembler, and the
prover are activated automatically, using {\em default parameters}.
\item[xvdelta]
This module is a primitve graphical user interface (GUI) for {\bf delta}
preprocessor.
It is based on XVIEW toolkit of X. {\bf xvdelta} facilitates the selection
of parameters of {\bf delta} and to control its operation.
\item[xvtheo]
This module is a primitve graphical user interface (GUI) for SETHEO.
It is based on XVIEW toolkit of X. {\bf xvtheo} allows to edit
a formula, to select approriate parameters (using pull-down menues),
to start the prover and to view the results.
{\bf xvtheo} calls all the basic progams.

SETHEOHOME

\section{clop}
{\bf Clop} combines the SETHEO compiler {\bf inwasm} with the
assembler {\bf wasm}. Given a {\em file\/}, first {\bf inwasm}
is invoked.
If the compilation phase terminated successfully, the
assembler {\bf wasm} is called with default parameters.
All parameters of {\bf clop} are passed to {\bf inwasm}.

\begin{description}
\item[Synopsis:]
clop [-$par_1$]\ldots[-$par_n$] {\em file}
\item[Input:] {\em file}.lop
\item[Output:] {\em file}.hex
\item[Temp:] {\em file}.s (not removed)
\item[Return Values:]
	{\bf Clop} returns $0$ is case of successful compilation.
	Otherwise the non-zero return value of the module in which
	the error occurred, is returned.
\item[Parameters:]
	All given parameters are passed to the {\bf inwasm}.
\item[Environment:]
	The variable {\tt SETHEOHOME} indicates the place where
	{\bf inwasm} and {\bf wasm} reside. If this variable is
	not defined, a default value is taken.

\section{\SAM\ Assembler Syntax}
Assembler code for the SETHEO Abstract machine \SAM\ is typically
generated by the compiler {\bf inwasm}. Per default, \SAM-assembler
code is kept in files with the extension ``.s''. The assembler code
can be processed by {\bf wasm} in order to generate binary code for the
\SAM.
The assembler language of SETHEO is defined in a very straight forward
way. Each line of the input file can be empty, may contain
a {\em directive\/}, a {\em label}, or an {\em assembler instruction}.

\begin{verbatim}
assembler_code ::= line '\n'
	| line '\n' assembler_code

line ::= 
         | LABEL ':' 
         | '.' directive
         | statement 

LABEL ::= [A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*
\end{verbatim}

Comments are C-like and enclosed in {\tt /* \ldots */}.

\subsection{Directives}
Each directive starts with a '.', followed by an identifier and
arguments. Directives control the operation of the assembler and do
not generate any code.

\begin{verbatim}
directive ::=
            'include' STRING
          | 'equ' LABEL numexpr
          | 'dw'  exprlist
          | 'ds'  numexpr
          | 'start' numexpr
          | 'org' numexpr
          | 'symb' STRING ',' symbtype ',' numexpr
          | 'clause' numexpr ',' numexpr
          | 'red'   numexpr
          | 'optim'
          | 'noopt'

symbtype ::=
          'const' | 'var' | 'pred' | 'global' | 'gterm' | 'ngterm'

exprlist ::= expr
          | exprlist ',' expr

exprlist ::= numexpr
          | TAG numexpr

TAG ::=
        'const' | 'cref' | 'eostr' | 'var' | 'gterm'
        | 'ngterm' | 'crterm' | 'cstrvar'
\end{verbatim}

A numeric expression {\tt numexpr} can be a number, a label, or a
sum or difference of numeric expressions. Labels need not be defined
when they are used. However, if a label occurrs in a sum or difference,
it must be defined in order to yield a defined result.
Both {\tt +} and {\tt --} are left associative.

\begin{verbatim}
numexpr ::=
	LABEL
        | NUMBER
        | numexpr '+' numexpr
        | numexpr '-' numexpr

NUMBER  ::= [0-9][0-9]*
\end{verbatim}

\noindent{\bf include}
includes the named file {\tt STRING}. Nested includes are possible up
to 8 levels.

\noindent{\bf equ}
\noindent{\bf dw}
\noindent{\bf ds}
\noindent{\bf start}
\noindent{\bf org}
\noindent{\bf symb}
\noindent{\bf clause}
\noindent{\bf red}
\noindent{\bf optim, noopt}

\subsection{Statements}

\begin{verbatim}
statement ::=
	instruction0
        | instruction1 expr
        | instruction2 expr ',' expr
        | instruction3 expr ',' expr ',' expr

instruction0 ::=
        'stop' | 'told' | ...

instruction1 ::=
        'alloc' | 'isunifiable' | ...

instruction2 ::=
        'assign' | 'call' | ...

instruction3 ::=
        'eqpred' | 'porbranch' | ...

expr ::=
        NUMBER
        | LABEL
\end{verbatim}

\section{\SAM\ Machine Code Syntax}
Machine code for the SETHEO Abstract Machine \SAM\ is always located
in files with the extension ``.hex''. 
Each entry in this file occupies one line.
A one-character identifier is used
to select the appropriate type of data, contained in the current
line.
Blank lines, comments or extra spaces are not allowed.

The following grammar shows the definition of the \SAM\ Machine
Code:

\begin{verbatim}
file    ::= lines

lines   ::= line
          | lines line

line    ::= 
       ':' ident ':' address ':' data ':' string '\n'

ident   ::= 'C' | 'Y' | 'E' | 'S' | 'M' | 'N'


address ::= [0-9A-F]{8}
data    ::= [0-9A-F]{8}
string  ::= [A-Za-z_0-9]
\end{verbatim}

The following table shows the meaning of the fields, corresponding to
the given identifier:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
C & word in code area of \SAM &
	\SAM-code-address & contents & --- \\
Y & symbol &
	type of symbol & arity & printname \\
S & set start-address &
	\SAM-code-address & --- & --- \\
M & highest address in code area of \SAM &
	 0 & highest \SAM-code-address & --- \\
N & number of symbols &
	 0 & number of symbols & --- \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent{\bf Notes:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
A ``highest memory address'' (identifier: ``M'')
directive must be placed prior to any code words (``C'') in order
to be effective. Otherwise, the size of the code-area of the \SAM\ is
determined by a default value (or the {\bf sam} parameter -code).
\item
The relative line number of a ``symbol'' directive determines the index
of that symbol in the symbol table. Therefore, the order of these
directives must not be changed and their number must not be 
increased or decreased.
\item
Special characters in a symbol are encoded by: \verb+\OOO+
where {\tt OOO} is the 3-digit octal value of the ASCII code of that
character. E.g. \verb+\007+ is for {\tt BELL}.
\item
The maximal length of a symbol is limited to 42 on the 
generation side ({\bf wasm}), and to 200 in the reader of
the abstract machine.
This limit includes special characters (see above). Each such character
contributes 4 to the total length of the symbol.
\item
all other directives may be intermixed and arbitrarily changed in order.
\item
A file with machine code must at least contain one line.
\end{enumerate}
