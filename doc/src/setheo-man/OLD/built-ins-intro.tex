\section{List of Built-Ins}

The SETHEO system provides a number of built-in predicates
for programming and control purposes.
Most of them are used in a similar way to PROLOG, but several
differences exist.

The following list describes all built-in predicates, available
with SETHEO Version V3.3
This list is likely to be extended in future versions of SETHEO.
Therefore, changes are marked clearly.
Furthermore, built-ins can be implemented by the user, using
SETHEO's C-interface as described in Section~\ref{sec:C-interface}.
However, no support is provided in this case.

Syntactically, a built-in predicate is an {\tt ATOM} 
(in the LOP-file), corresponding to the syntax definition in
Section~\ref{sec:lop-syntax}.
Whereas most built-in predicates are in prefix notation
(of the form $p$ or $p(t_1,\ldots,t_n)$), some are available
in infix notation. These built-ins (mostly arithmetic) can be
used 
A built-in predicate must always
