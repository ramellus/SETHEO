\section{Installing the Binaries}\label{sec:inst-bin}

After getting the binaries as described in Section~\ref{sec:get-bin}
all binaries and shell scripts reside in the same directory. The only
thing you have to do now is to set the path variable {\tt SETHEOHOME}
as described in Section~\ref{sec:environ}.

It is even possible to run the SETHEO system without having set the path
variable. In this case you have to look for the variable {\tt
SETHEOHOME} within the shell scripts. Now set in each shell script the
path variable to the directory where the binaries and shell scripts
reside. 

If you want to move the binaries or shell scripts to different
directories, you also have to change the path variables in each shell
script.
