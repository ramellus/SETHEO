\section{Introduction}

This Section is about how to install the SETHEO system at your own
computer. For Sun Sparc stations binaries of the SETHEO code are
available via ftp. If you run another operation system or if you want
to look at the code, too, you can also get the sources. 
The installation both of the binaries and of the sources is described
in detail.

Not only the programs but also examples and manpages are delivered by
ftp. 
If you are interested in being up to date concerning SETHEO you can
register as a SETHEO user. Just send back the users registration form
which is part of the ftp--package.
